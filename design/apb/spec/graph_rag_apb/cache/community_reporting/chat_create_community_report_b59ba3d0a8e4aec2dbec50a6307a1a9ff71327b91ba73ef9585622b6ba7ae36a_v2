Initially designed to transport 8-bit data, it has been adapted in certain implementations to handle 16-bit data as well. The protocol is widely used in various applications, including reading configuration data from memory sticks, supporting systems management functions, and accessing non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) chips.  \n\nI²C's flexibility allows it to operate in multimaster configurations, enabling multiple controllers to communicate with peripheral devices over the same bus. While its primary use case involves analog device interfacing, its adaptability has expanded its utility to digital systems, particularly where efficient, low-speed communication is required. The protocol's ability to support both 8-bit and 16-bit data formats makes it versatile for different hardware requirements.  \n\nIn summary, I²C is a robust, widely adopted protocol that facilitates communication between microcontrollers and peripheral devices, with applications ranging from analog interfacing to digital configuration and systems management. Its multimaster capability and adaptability to varying data widths contribute to its enduring relevance in embedded systems and hardware design.\",6\r\n20,APB,\"**APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus)** is a protocol defined by ARM, designed primarily as an interface for low-bandwidth peripherals. It operates as an unpipelined protocol, meaning it does not support overlapping transactions, and all signal transitions are synchronized to the rising edge of the clock. Each transfer in APB requires at least two clock cycles, making it suitable for simpler, low-performance peripheral connections.  \n\nAPB is often used in conjunction with other protocols, such as **I²C**, particularly within the **Top block** of a system, where it facilitates communication between peripherals and the main bus. While it is not a high-speed interface, its simplicity and efficiency make it ideal for connecting peripherals that do not demand high bandwidth.  \n\nIn summary, APB serves as a standardized, low-complexity interface protocol within ARM-based systems, optimized for low-power and low-performance peripheral interactions. Its design ensures reliable communication with minimal overhead, often complementing other bus protocols like I²C in larger system architectures.\",8\r\n23,FIGURE 1,\"**Summary of FIGURE 1:**  \n\nFIGURE 1 depicts the **APBI2C top block**, which serves as an interface between the **APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus)** and **I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)** protocols.

Specifically, it depicts a read failure indicated by a **PSLVERR** (Peripheral Slave Error) signal when the APB attempts to read data. The figure serves as a visual representation of this protocol violation, highlighting the occurrence of an erroneous read transaction. Both descriptions confirm that the error arises during a read operation, with the second description providing additional detail about the **PSLVERR** signal, which signifies a slave-reported failure. The unified interpretation is that **FIGURE 4** demonstrates a read error in the APB Protocol, where the attempted data access results in a failure signaled by **PSLVERR**.  \n\n(Word count: 100)\",1\r\n50,FIGURE 5,\"**FIGURE 5** depicts error scenarios in the APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) protocol, covering both write and read operations. The figure illustrates a write error (\"\"APB Protocol write ERROR\"\") as well as a read failure (\"\"read PSLVERR fail\"\") when the APB attempts to read data. The read error is described as being similar in nature to the write protocol error, suggesting a consistent failure mechanism across both operations. Together, these descriptions indicate that **FIGURE 5** serves as a visual representation of error conditions in APB transactions, highlighting potential issues in data transfer during both write and read phases.
