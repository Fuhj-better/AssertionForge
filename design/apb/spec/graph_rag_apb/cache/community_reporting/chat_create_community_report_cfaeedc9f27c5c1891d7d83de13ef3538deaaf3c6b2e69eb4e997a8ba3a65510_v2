Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\r\n20,APB,\"**APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus)** is a protocol defined by ARM, designed primarily as an interface for low-bandwidth peripherals. It operates as an unpipelined protocol, meaning it does not support overlapping transactions, and all signal transitions are synchronized to the rising edge of the clock. Each transfer in APB requires at least two clock cycles, making it suitable for simpler, low-performance peripheral connections.  \n\nAPB is often used in conjunction with other protocols, such as **I²C**, particularly within the **Top block** of a system, where it facilitates communication between peripherals and the main bus. While it is not a high-speed interface, its simplicity and efficiency make it ideal for connecting peripherals that do not demand high bandwidth.  \n\nIn summary, APB serves as a standardized, low-complexity interface protocol within ARM-based systems, optimized for low-power and low-performance peripheral interactions. Its design ensures reliable communication with minimal overhead, often complementing other bus protocols like I²C in larger system architectures.\",8\r\n29,PENABLE,\"PENABLE is an input signal of size 1, related to APB protocol operations.\"\"\",2\r\n30,PREADY,\"PREADY is an output pin; I2C responds to the APB block indicating data is ready to be read or written.\"\"\",1\r\n47,FIGURE 2,\"**FIGURE 2** illustrates the Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) Protocol write operation. The figure provides a visual representation of the protocol used for writing data to the APB, detailing the sequence and timing of signals involved in the process. Both descriptions confirm that **FIGURE 2** serves as a reference for understanding the APB write protocol, with no contradictory information present. The unified summary emphasizes that the figure is a clear and concise depiction of the write procedure for the APB interface.  \n\n(Word count: 78)\",1\r\n48,FIGURE 3,\"**FIGURE 3** illustrates the Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) Protocol read operation. The figure provides a visual representation of the protocol used for reading data from the APB, detailing the sequence and timing of signals involved in the process. Both descriptions confirm that **FIGURE 3** serves as a reference for understanding the APB read protocol, with no contradictions between them. The figure is a key resource for comprehending the communication flow and signal interactions during APB read transactions.  \n\n(Word count: 78)\",1\r\n49,FIGURE 4,\"**FIGURE 4** illustrates an error scenario in the APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) Protocol during a read operation. Specifically, it depicts a read failure indicated by a **PSLVERR** (Peripheral Slave Error) signal when the APB attempts to read data. The figure serves as a visual representation of this protocol violation, highlighting the occurrence of an erroneous read transaction. Both descriptions confirm that the error arises during a read operation, with the second description providing additional detail about the **PSLVERR** signal, which signifies a slave-reported failure. The unified interpretation is that **FIGURE 4** demonstrates a read error in the APB Protocol, where the attempted data access results in a failure signaled by **PSLVERR**.  \n\n(Word count: 100)\",1\r\n50,FIGURE 5,\"**FIGURE 5** depicts error scenarios in the APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) protocol, covering both write and read operations. The figure illustrates a write error (\"\"APB Protocol write ERROR\"\") as well as a read failure (\"\"read PSLVERR fail\"\") when the APB attempts to read data. The read error is described as being similar in nature to the write protocol error, suggesting a consistent failure mechanism across both operations. Together, these descriptions indicate that **FIGURE 5** serves as a visual representation of error conditions in APB transactions, highlighting potential issues in data transfer during both write and read phases.
