Initially designed to transport 8-bit data, it has been adapted in certain implementations to handle 16-bit data as well. The protocol is widely used in various applications, including reading configuration data from memory sticks, supporting systems management functions, and accessing non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) chips.  \n\nI²C's flexibility allows it to operate in multimaster configurations, enabling multiple controllers to communicate with peripheral devices over the same bus. While its primary use case involves analog device interfacing, its adaptability has expanded its utility to digital systems, particularly where efficient, low-speed communication is required. The protocol's ability to support both 8-bit and 16-bit data formats makes it versatile for different hardware requirements.  \n\nIn summary, I²C is a robust, widely adopted protocol that facilitates communication between microcontrollers and peripheral devices, with applications ranging from analog interfacing to digital configuration and systems management. Its multimaster capability and adaptability to varying data widths contribute to its enduring relevance in embedded systems and hardware design.\",6\r\n23,FIGURE 1,\"**Summary of FIGURE 1:**  \n\nFIGURE 1 depicts the **APBI2C top block**, which serves as an interface between the **APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus)** and **I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)** protocols. The figure illustrates how the top-level block facilitates communication between these two protocols, highlighting their interconnection. The descriptions consistently emphasize that FIGURE 1 focuses on the structural or functional representation of this interface, with no contradictory information present.  \n\nIn summary, FIGURE 1 provides a clear visualization of the **APBI2C top block**, showcasing its role in bridging APB and I²C protocols. The unified description confirms that the figure is centered on this specific interface without discrepancies.  \n\n*(Word count: 100)*\",3\r\n22,SCL,\"The **SCL** (Serial Clock Line) is a bidirectional clock port utilized in the **I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)** communication protocol. It serves as the clock signal line responsible for synchronizing data transmission between devices connected via the I²C bus. As a bidirectional port, SCL allows for flexible control of data transport, enabling both the master and slave devices to influence the clock signal under specific conditions, such as clock stretching. This functionality ensures efficient and coordinated data exchange within the I²C system.  \n\nIn summary, **SCL** is a critical component of the I²C protocol, functioning as a bidirectional clock line that regulates the timing and flow of data between connected devices.\",2\r\n31,PSELX,\"PSELx is an input pin used to select I²C.\"\"\",1\r\n21,SDA,\"The **SDA (Serial Data Line)** is a bidirectional data transport port primarily utilized by the **I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)** communication protocol. As a bidirectional port, it facilitates the transmission and reception of data between devices connected via the I²C bus. This dual-directional capability allows for efficient data exchange, enabling multiple devices to communicate over a shared bus structure. The SDA line, along with the **SCL (Serial Clock Line)**, forms the core of the I²C interface, ensuring synchronized and reliable data transfer. Its bidirectional nature distinguishes it from unidirectional ports, making it a versatile component in embedded systems and low-speed peripheral communication.  \n\nIn summary, the **SDA** serves as a critical bidirectional data transport port within the I²C protocol, supporting seamless data exchange between interconnected devices.\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n19,I²C,APB,\"The **I²C** (Inter-Integrated Circuit) and **APB** (Advanced Peripheral Bus) are two protocols that work together in the **Top block** of a system. I²C is a widely used serial communication protocol for connecting low-speed peripherals, while APB is a simpler, low-power bus protocol typically used for peripheral interfacing in ARM-based systems.  \n\nIn this configuration, **I²C utilizes the APB protocol as its interface solution**, indicating that the I²C peripheral communicates with the rest of the system through an APB bus. This setup allows I²C to integrate seamlessly into systems where APB is the primary bus for peripheral connectivity. The combination of these two protocols in the **Top block** suggests a design where I²C peripherals are accessed and controlled via the APB interface, ensuring efficient and standardized communication within the system.  \n\nThis integration highlights a common practice in embedded systems, where multiple protocols are used in conjunction to leverage their respective strengths—I²C for device-to-device communication and APB for streamlined peripheral bus management.
