The table consolidates the pinout descriptions used for individual blocks, ensuring clarity and consistency in the system's design and implementation. By presenting both the technical specifications (signal names, directions, and sizes) and their corresponding descriptions, TABLE 1 facilitates efficient system integration and troubleshooting.  \n\nThis unified summary resolves any minor discrepancies between the two descriptions by combining their key points into a single coherent overview.
