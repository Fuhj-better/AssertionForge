The figure highlights specific cases where a NACK (Negative Acknowledgment) occurs, as well as subsequent retransmission attempts. By combining these descriptions, it is clear that **FIGURE 7** serves as a visual representation of error-handling mechanisms in I²C communication, particularly focusing on failed transmissions and the associated recovery processes. The figure provides insight into how the protocol manages communication errors, including the conditions under which NACKs are generated and how retransmissions are initiated to ensure data integrity.  \n\nIn summary, **FIGURE 7** offers a detailed view of non-standard I²C transmission failures, emphasizing both the detection of errors (via NACK) and the corrective actions (retransmission) taken to maintain reliable communication. The combined descriptions confirm that the figure is a technical reference for understanding fault scenarios in I²C protocols.  \n\n(Word count: 149)", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751292094, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 204, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 380, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 48}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
