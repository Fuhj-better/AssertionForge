However, its development is ongoing, and further verification is needed to ensure proper operation. This includes waveform analysis for both transmission and reception to validate its performance.  \n\nIn summary, the I²C Module is a work-in-progress component designed to handle I²C communication, relying on FIFO data and register configurations.
