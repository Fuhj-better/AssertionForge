To read from the RX FIFO, the address bus **PADDR** must be set to **4h** (hexadecimal 4), and the write signal **PWRITE** must be disabled (set to a low logic level). Both descriptions confirm this behavior, indicating that reading from the RX FIFO requires these two conditions: a valid address (4h) and an inactive write signal (PWRITE low). There are no contradictions between the provided descriptions, as they consistently describe the same access mechanism for the RX FIFO.  \n\nIn summary, the **RX FIFO** operates under the condition that a read operation is initiated when **PADDR = 4h** and **PWRITE is low**, ensuring proper data retrieval from the FIFO buffer.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751291493, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 179, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 363, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 56}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
