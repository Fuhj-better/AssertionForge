It features two bits that specifically define the operational mode, ensuring proper communication and control within the I2C system.  \n\nFor the I2C module to function correctly, the **CONFIGURATION REGISTER** must be properly initialized. This involves setting up the register to enable clock generation and transmit (TX) operation, which are essential for I2C communication. After a system reset, the register is typically written to activate these features, ensuring the module is ready for operation.  \n\nIn summary, the **CONFIGURATION REGISTER** serves as a key control element in the I2C module, with its two mode-determining bits and mandatory setup requirements for clock generation and TX operation.
