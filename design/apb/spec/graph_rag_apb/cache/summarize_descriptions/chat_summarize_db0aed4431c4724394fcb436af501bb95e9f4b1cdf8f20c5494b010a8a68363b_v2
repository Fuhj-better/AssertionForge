To read data from the RX FIFO, the system must set the address bus (**PADDR**) to the hexadecimal value **4h** and ensure the write control signal (**PWRITE**) is disabled (set to a low state). This configuration allows the RX FIFO to be accessed for reading operations.  \n\nIn summary, the RX FIFO serves as a buffer for incoming data, triggers an interrupt upon emptying, and is read by configuring **PADDR** to **4h** while keeping **PWRITE** low. This ensures consistent and correct access to the stored data.
