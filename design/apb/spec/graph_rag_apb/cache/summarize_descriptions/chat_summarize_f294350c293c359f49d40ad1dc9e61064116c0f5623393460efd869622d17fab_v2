An earlier description mentions an initial frequency range of **100 kHz**, likely referring to the lower bound of the full range. The two descriptions are not contradictory but rather complementary, with the first providing the complete validated range (100 kHzâ€“5 MHz) and the second emphasizing the baseline frequency (100 kHz).  \n\nIn summary, **CLOCK RANGE WORK** operates within a clock frequency range of **100 kHz to 5 MHz**, with 100 kHz serving as the minimum required frequency.
