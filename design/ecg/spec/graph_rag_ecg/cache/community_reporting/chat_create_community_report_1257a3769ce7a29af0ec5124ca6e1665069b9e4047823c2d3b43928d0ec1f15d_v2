Its functionality includes handling the interface signals as detailed in **Table 2**, ensuring efficient and accurate computation of scalar products in elliptic curve arithmetic.  \n\nWhile one description refers to the operation as \"\"the addition of many identical elliptic curve group elements,\"\" this is effectively another way of describing scalar multiplication, where repeated addition of a point to itself yields the same result as multiplying the point by an integer scalar.
