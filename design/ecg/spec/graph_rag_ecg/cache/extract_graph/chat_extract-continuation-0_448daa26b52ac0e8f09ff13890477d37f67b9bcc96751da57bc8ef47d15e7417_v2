An element in the elliptic curve \ngroup is also called “a point”. The elliptic curve group is abelian. The group law is as \nfollows.  \nSuppose    (     )    (     )          (     ). Then,  \n     \n    (      ) \n             \n                    \n                   ⁄    (       (     )) \n                 (     )(     ) ⁄     (                 ) \nIn the following,       will be also called the addition of (elliptic curve group element) \n   and   . Given a positive integer   , let      represent  the addition of   identical \n(elliptic curve group element)   , i.e.                  (       ). Computation \nof      proceeds as follows.  \n1:          \n2: while     do   \n3:     if   is odd then       \n4:           \n5:            (  ⁄) \n6:   \n7: return   \nFor more information about the elliptic curve group, please refer to  [1].

Two \nmodules are separately listed.  \nInput signals are synchronous  and sampled at the rising edge of the clock. Output signals \nare driven by flip -flops, and not directly connected to input signals by combinational \nlogic.
