It performs point addition operations, which are fundamental to elliptic curve arithmetic, and includes detailed timing patterns and synthesis results for optimization and analysis. The module is designed to efficiently handle the mathematical operations required for elliptic curve cryptography, ensuring both accuracy and performance in its computations.  \n\nBy integrating timing and synthesis data, **POINT_ADD** supports hardware or software implementations where latency and resource utilization are critical considerations. This makes it a key component in cryptographic systems that rely on elliptic curve operations, such as digital signatures and key exchange protocols.
