The module computes the result of adding a single elliptic curve point to itself multiple times, which is equivalent to multiplying the point by a scalar value. Its functionality includes handling the interface signals as detailed in **Table 2**, ensuring efficient and accurate computation of scalar products in elliptic curve arithmetic.  \n\nWhile one description refers to the operation as \"the addition of many identical elliptic curve group elements,\" this is effectively another way of describing scalar multiplication, where repeated addition of a point to itself yields the same result as multiplying the point by an integer scalar. Thus, both descriptions align in their explanation of the module's core purpose: performing scalar multiplication within the elliptic curve group framework.  \n\nIn summary, **POINT_SCALAR_MULT** is a critical component of the **Elliptic Curve Group Core**, specializing in scalar multiplication operations with clearly defined interface signals for integration and use in cryptographic or mathematical applications involving elliptic curves.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751796060, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 215, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 414, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 135}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
