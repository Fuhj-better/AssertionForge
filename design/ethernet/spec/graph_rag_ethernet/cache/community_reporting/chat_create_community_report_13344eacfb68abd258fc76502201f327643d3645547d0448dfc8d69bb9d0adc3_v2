It serves a dual purpose: first, it facilitates the management of interrupt sources by enabling or disabling them as needed, and second, it provides a clear indication of the causes of interrupts, allowing the system to identify and respond to specific triggering events. By consolidating these functions, the INT_SOURCE register plays a critical role in interrupt handling, ensuring efficient and accurate processing of hardware or software-generated interrupts. Its design allows for both control and status monitoring, making it an essential component in systems that rely on interrupt-driven operations.\",3\r\n120,ETHERNET MAC CORE,\"Core component that handles Ethernet media access control functions.\"\"\",4\r\n119,RISC,\"**Summary of RISC:**  \n\nRISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) is a specialized component within the Ethernet IP Core that performs multiple critical functions related to data handling and communication. It directly writes data to configuration registers, enabling efficient control and customization of the Ethernet IP Core's operations. Additionally, RISC plays a key role in frame transmission preparation, ensuring that data packets are properly formatted and ready for transmission.  \n\nBeyond transmission, RISC also interacts with the Ethernet receive function, facilitating the processing of incoming data frames. This dual role in both transmit and receive operations highlights its importance in managing bidirectional communication within the Ethernet IP Core.  \n\nIn summary, RISC serves as a versatile and integral part of the Ethernet IP Core, handling configuration register writes, frame transmission preparation, and receive function interactions, all while adhering to the principles of a Reduced Instruction Set Computer architecture.  \n\n(Word count: 150)\",3\r\n96,RX BUFFER DESCRIPTORS,\"A section describing the receive buffer descriptors, containing information about received frames and pointers to data buffers.\",2\r\n113,RXPNT,\"The **RXPNT** (Receive Pointer) register is a hardware register that points to a buffer used for storing received data. Specifically, it serves as a pointer to the memory location where incoming data frames are stored. The descriptions provided indicate that the RXPNT register can reference either a general received data buffer or a buffer specifically allocated for the associated frame. These descriptions are not contradictory but rather complementary, as they highlight the register's role in managing received data, whether in a broader buffer or a frame-specific one.  \n\nIn summary, the **RXPNT** register functions as a pointer directing the system to the appropriate memory location where received data—either as part of a general buffer or a designated frame buffer—is stored for further processing.
