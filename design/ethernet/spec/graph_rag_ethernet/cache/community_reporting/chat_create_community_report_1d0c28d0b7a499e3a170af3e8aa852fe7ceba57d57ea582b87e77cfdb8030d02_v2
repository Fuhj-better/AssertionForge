It primarily handles PAUSE control frames and timer management to regulate data transmission efficiently. The module implements full-duplex flow control and consists of several sub-modules, including a **Control Frame Detector** for identifying incoming control frames, a **Generator** for creating control frames, and a **PAUSE Timer** to manage timing operations for flow control.  \n\nAdditionally, the MAC Control Module oversees Ethernet MAC control functions, ensuring seamless communication between the host system and the transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) modules. It acts as an intermediary, processing control frames and coordinating with other modules to maintain optimal data flow. Its responsibilities also include interfacing between the host and the Tx/Rx modules, further enhancing its role in network traffic management.  \n\nIn summary, the MAC Control Module is a versatile and integral part of Ethernet systems, specializing in flow control, PAUSE frame handling, and timer management. By integrating detection, generation, and timing functions, it ensures efficient and reliable full-duplex communication.\",22\r\n64,CTRLMODER,\"Control Module Mode Register with TXFLOW, RXFLOW, and PASSALL bits, reset value 00000000h.\",4\r\n129,PAUSE CONTROL FRAME,\"A control frame used in Ethernet flow control, with specific structure and fields like destination address, length/type, opcode, and pause timer value.\",3\r\n125,SLOT TIMER,\"**SLOT TIMER**  \n\nThe **SLOT TIMER** is a specialized timer utilized within the **MAC Control Module** to manage timing operations. It is activated when the **PAUSE Timer** is preloaded, functioning as a counter for slot times. As it counts each slot time, the **SLOT TIMER** generates corresponding pulses that are sent to the **PAUSE Timer**, ensuring synchronized timing operations within the system.  \n\nThis timer plays a critical role in coordinating timing-related tasks, particularly in scenarios where precise intervals must be tracked and communicated between components. By interfacing with the **PAUSE Timer**, the **SLOT TIMER** helps maintain accurate timing sequences, supporting the overall functionality of the **MAC Control Module**.  \n\nIn summary, the **SLOT TIMER** serves as a key timing mechanism, counting slot times and relaying pulse signals to the **PAUSE Timer**, thereby facilitating efficient and synchronized operations within the system.\",2\r\n126,CTRLMODER REGISTER,\"The **CTRLMODER REGISTER** (Control Mode Register) is a configuration register that manages transmission and reception behavior in a control module. It contains several control bits, including **RXFLOW**, which regulates receive flow control, and **TXFLOW**, which governs transmit flow control. Additionally, the register may include a **PASSALL** bit, though its exact function is not explicitly detailed in the provided descriptions.  \n\nThe register is referred to interchangeably as the **Control Mode Register** and the **Control Module Mode Register**, suggesting it serves a central role in configuring operational modes for data handling. Its primary purpose is to define how data flows during communication, with specific bits enabling or disabling flow control mechanisms for both incoming (RX) and outgoing (TX) data streams.  \n\nWhile the descriptions slightly vary in naming (Control Mode Register vs. Control Module Mode Register), they are consistent in function, confirming that the register is used to adjust transmission and reception settings. No direct contradictions exist between the descriptions, but the inclusion of **PASSALL** in only one suggests it may be an optional or secondary feature.  \n\nIn summary, the **CTRLMODER REGISTER** is a critical register for managing data flow control, primarily through **RXFLOW** and **TXFLOW** bits, with possible additional configuration options like **PASSALL**. Its exact naming may differ slightly, but its role in configuring communication behavior remains consistent.\",1\r\n127,INT_SOURCE REGISTER,Interrupt Source Register where RXC interrupt is set.,1\r\n131,TXCTRL REGISTER,Transmit Control Register used to issue PAUSE control frame requests and set pause timer values.,1\r\n132,TPAUSERQ,Transmit Pause Request signal asserted by host to initiate PAUSE control frame transmission.,1\r\n133,TXSTARTFRM,Transmit Packet Start Frame signal used to begin transmission of a PAUSE control frame.,1\r\n134,TXENDFRM,Transmit Packet End Frame signal indicating completion of PAUSE control frame transmission.,1\r\n135,TPAUSETV[15:0],Transmit Pause Timer Value register containing pause duration for control frames.,1\r\n136,TXDATA[7:0],8-bit transmit data port between host and MAC modules.,1\r\n137,TXUSEDDATA,Signal indicating data has been consumed by transmit function.,1\r\n138,TXDONE,Signal indicating completion of frame transmission.,1\r\n139,TXABORT,Signal indicating transmission abort request.,1\r\n68,TXFLOW,,2\r\n69,RXFLOW,,2\r\n70,PASSALL,,2\r\n124,PAUSE TIMER,\"The **PAUSE TIMER** is a 16-bit timer utilized within the **MAC Control Module** for flow control purposes. It is loaded with a pause timer value extracted from a **PAUSE control frame**, which temporarily inhibits data frame transmissions for a specified number of time slots. This mechanism ensures efficient network traffic management by preventing congestion and allowing controlled pauses in data transmission when necessary.  \n\nBy integrating both functionalities—acting as a timer for flow control and enforcing transmission pauses based on PAUSE frame directives—the **PAUSE TIMER** plays a critical role in maintaining stable and orderly communication within the network. Its 16-bit design allows for precise timing control, ensuring compliance with flow control protocols.\",3\r\n130,FIGURE 3,\"Figure 3 illustrates the structure of the PAUSE control frame, including fields like destination address, length/type, opcode, and pause timer value.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n109,MAC CONTROL MODULE,CTRLMODER,The MAC Control Module uses CTRLMODER register for flow control configuration,26\r\n150,PAUSE CONTROL FRAME,MAC CONTROL MODULE,MAC Control Module handles the transmission and reception of PAUSE control frames,25\r\n146,MAC CONTROL MODULE,SLOT TIMER,MAC Control Module uses Slot Timer for timing,24\r\n147,MAC CONTROL MODULE,CTRLMODER REGISTER,\"The **MAC Control Module** is a hardware component whose behavior is configured and controlled through the **CTRLMODER register**.
