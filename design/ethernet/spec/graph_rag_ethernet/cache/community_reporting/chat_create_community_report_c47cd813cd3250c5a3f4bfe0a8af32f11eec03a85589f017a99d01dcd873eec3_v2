It primarily handles PAUSE control frames and timer management to regulate data transmission efficiently. The module implements full-duplex flow control and consists of several sub-modules, including a **Control Frame Detector** for identifying incoming control frames, a **Generator** for creating control frames, and a **PAUSE Timer** to manage timing operations for flow control.  \n\nAdditionally, the MAC Control Module oversees Ethernet MAC control functions, ensuring seamless communication between the host system and the transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) modules. It acts as an intermediary, processing control frames and coordinating with other modules to maintain optimal data flow. Its responsibilities also include interfacing between the host and the Tx/Rx modules, further enhancing its role in network traffic management.  \n\nIn summary, the MAC Control Module is a versatile and integral part of Ethernet systems, specializing in flow control, PAUSE frame handling, and timer management. By integrating detection, generation, and timing functions, it ensures efficient and reliable full-duplex communication.\",22\r\n126,CTRLMODER REGISTER,\"The **CTRLMODER REGISTER** (Control Mode Register) is a configuration register that manages transmission and reception behavior in a control module. It contains several control bits, including **RXFLOW**, which regulates receive flow control, and **TXFLOW**, which governs transmit flow control. Additionally, the register may include a **PASSALL** bit, though its exact function is not explicitly detailed in the provided descriptions.  \n\nThe register is referred to interchangeably as the **Control Mode Register** and the **Control Module Mode Register**, suggesting it serves a central role in configuring operational modes for data handling. Its primary purpose is to define how data flows during communication, with specific bits enabling or disabling flow control mechanisms for both incoming (RX) and outgoing (TX) data streams.  \n\nWhile the descriptions slightly vary in naming (Control Mode Register vs. Control Module Mode Register), they are consistent in function, confirming that the register is used to adjust transmission and reception settings. No direct contradictions exist between the descriptions, but the inclusion of **PASSALL** in only one suggests it may be an optional or secondary feature.  \n\nIn summary, the **CTRLMODER REGISTER** is a critical register for managing data flow control, primarily through **RXFLOW** and **TXFLOW** bits, with possible additional configuration options like **PASSALL**. Its exact naming may differ slightly, but its role in configuring communication behavior remains consistent.\",1\r\n127,INT_SOURCE REGISTER,Interrupt Source Register where RXC interrupt is set.,1\r\n131,TXCTRL REGISTER,Transmit Control Register used to issue PAUSE control frame requests and set pause timer values.,1\r\n132,TPAUSERQ,Transmit Pause Request signal asserted by host to initiate PAUSE control frame transmission.,1\r\n133,TXSTARTFRM,Transmit Packet Start Frame signal used to begin transmission of a PAUSE control frame.,1\r\n134,TXENDFRM,Transmit Packet End Frame signal indicating completion of PAUSE control frame transmission.,1\r\n135,TPAUSETV[15:0],Transmit Pause Timer Value register containing pause duration for control frames.,1\r\n136,TXDATA[7:0],8-bit transmit data port between host and MAC modules.,1\r\n137,TXUSEDDATA,Signal indicating data has been consumed by transmit function.,1\r\n138,TXDONE,Signal indicating completion of frame transmission.,1\r\n139,TXABORT,Signal indicating transmission abort request.,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n109,MAC CONTROL MODULE,CTRLMODER,The MAC Control Module uses CTRLMODER register for flow control configuration,26\r\n147,MAC CONTROL MODULE,CTRLMODER REGISTER,\"The **MAC Control Module** is a hardware component whose behavior is configured and controlled through the **CTRLMODER register**.
