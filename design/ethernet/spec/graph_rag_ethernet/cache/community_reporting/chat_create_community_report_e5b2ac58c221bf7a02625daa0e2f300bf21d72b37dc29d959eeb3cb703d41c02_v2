It specifies both the minimum and maximum frame lengths, with the minimum set at 64 bytes (64B) and the maximum at 1518 bytes (1518B). These values are referenced in the descriptions of other control bits, such as **TL** (Transfer Length) and **SF** (Start Frame), to ensure compliance with Ethernet standards. The register serves as a critical reference for validating packet sizes, ensuring that frames adhere to the defined length constraints for proper network operation.  \n\nIn summary, **PACKETLEN** is a configuration register that establishes the allowable range for Ethernet frame lengths, playing a key role in maintaining protocol compliance and efficient data transmission.\",2\r\n65,MIISTATUS,\"The **MIISTATUS** register is a status register that monitors the operation status of the Media Independent Interface (MII). It contains multiple status bits, including **NVALID**, **BUSY**, and **LINKFAIL**, which provide information about the current state of MII operations. The **BUSY** bit specifically indicates whether the MII interface is actively engaged in an operation, while the **LINKFAIL** bit signals potential link failures. The **NVALID** bit may indicate whether the data being processed is valid.  \n\nThe register serves as a critical indicator for MII functionality, consolidating key operational signals into a single accessible location. The descriptions confirm that the **BUSY** signal is a central component of the register, reflecting the MII's activity state. There are no contradictions between the provided descriptions; rather, they complement each other by detailing different aspects of the register's functionality.  \n\nIn summary, the **MIISTATUS** register is a unified status indicator for MII operations, tracking activity (via **BUSY**), link integrity (via **LINKFAIL**), and data validity (via **NVALID**), ensuring efficient monitoring and troubleshooting of the MII interface.\",2\r\n1,JEANNE WIEGELMANN,\"Document reviser for the Ethernet IP Core Specification, contributed to revision 1.13.\",1\r\n9,REV. 1.19,,1\r\n10,OPENCORES.ORG,\"**OPENCORES.ORG** is an organization dedicated to hosting and maintaining open-source hardware projects, including the **Ethernet IP Core Specification** document and its revisions.

It provides bit-specific masking capabilities, allowing precise control over various interrupt sources. The register enables or disables interrupts by setting or clearing individual bits, effectively determining which interrupt events are permitted to trigger.  \n\nINT_MASK serves as a critical component in interrupt handling, offering granular control to either mask (disable) or unmask (enable) specific interrupt sources. This functionality ensures that only relevant interrupts are processed while others are temporarily suppressed, improving system efficiency and reducing unnecessary processing overhead.  \n\nIn summary, INT_MASK is an interrupt mask register that governs interrupt events for the Ethernet IP core, providing configurable masking capabilities to selectively enable or disable interrupt sources as needed. Its bit-level control allows for flexible and precise interrupt management.\",1\r\n20,IPGT,\"The **IPGT (Back-to-Back Inter-Packet Gap Register)** is a hardware register that defines and controls timing parameters for data transmission in both full-duplex and half-duplex operations.
