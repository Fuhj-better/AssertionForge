RXB interrupt in the INT_SOURCE register is set to 1.  \n \nNote: If both RXFLOW and PASSALL bits are set to 1, then only RXC interrupt is \nset in the INT_SOURCE register when a control frame is received.  \nNovember 27, 2002    Ethernet IP Core Specification \n   \n \nhttp://www.opencores.org  Rev 1.19  32 of 42 A valid PAUSE control frame has the frame structure described in Figure 3: \nFigure 3: Structure of the PAUSE control frame \n \nThe destination address must be a reserved multicast address (01-80-c2-00-00-01) or a \ndestination address equal to the Ethernet IP Core MAC address. The Length/Type field must be equal to 8808 and the opcode to 0001 for a PAUSE control frame.  \nWhen the receive flow control and the MAC Control Module are enabled (RXFLOW \nasserted and PASSALL deasserted), a PAUSE Timer Value from the PAUSE control frame is passed to the PAUSE timer. \n \n4.5.2 Control Frame Generation \nWhen the host wants to send a PAUSE control frame, it asserts the Transmit Pause \nRequest (TPAUSERQ). When a request is detected, the control module waits for the current transmission to end. It then starts transmitting the PAUSE control frame by asserting the Transmit Packet Start Frame (TxStartFrm) and providing the appropriate control data. Sending CtrlFrm is used to instruct the Transmit function (TX Ethernet MAC) to pad and append the FCS. The transmit Pause Frame End (TxEndFrm) is asserted at the end to inform the host that a Pause request was sent.  \nAsserting the TXFLOW bit in the CTRLMODER register enables the transmission of the \nPAUSE control frame.  \nWhen the control frame needs to be sent, the request is issued by writing the appropriate \nvalue to the TXCTRL register. The Transmit Pause Timer Value TPAUSETV[15:0] contains the value to be sent as a Pause Timer Value in the pause control frame (Figure 3). The TPAUSERQ signal (request) is latched internally in the MAC Control Generator and reset after the PAUSE control frame has been transmitted. This prevents issuing a new PAUSE request until the current request is sent.  \n Dest.

These signals are connected directly between the host and the MAC transmit and receive functions when data frames (not control frames) are transmitted or received.  \nOn the other hand, when a host wants to send a PAUSE control frame, it asserts a \nTPauseRQ request signal. It is then up to the MAC Control Module to initiate the transmission. In this case, the above signals are not connected to the host any more. The MAC Control Module drives the appropriate control data signals and instructs the Tx module to transmit.  \nWhen a PAUSE control frame is received, the frame can be dropped or passed to the \nhost, depending on the state of the PASSALL and RXFLOW bits (See section 3.10 CTRLMODER (Control Module Mode Register) for more details). Again TxData[7:0], TxStartFrm, TxEndFrm, TxUsedData, TxDone, and TxAbort are not connected directly. \n \n4.5.4 PAUSE Timer \nThe 16bit PAUSE timer is loaded with a pause timer value when a PAUSE control frame \nis received. The timer inhibits the data frame transmissions for the timer value time slots. This is done by:  \n/checkbld Preventing the Tx MAC module from seeing the signal TxStartFrm from the host \n/checkbld Preventing the host from seeing the signal TxUsedData from the Tx module \nThe timer decrements by one each time a time slot passes by. A Slot Timer is used for \ncounting the slot time.   \n \n4.5.5 Slot Timer \nThe Slot Timer is activated when a PAUSE Timer is preloaded. It counts slot times and \ngenerates pulses to the PAUSE Timer for every slot time passed. Slot time is time,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_b338f0a79859ecd0a328db988a558b48807686f048e3b14d863887bbf8015657_v2"}
