Registers are also part of the host interface.  \n/checkbld The TX Ethernet MAC performs transmit functions. \n/checkbld The RX Ethernet MAC performs receive functions. \n/checkbld The MAC Control Module performs full duplex flow control functions. \n/checkbld The MII Management Module performs PHY control and gathers the status information from it. \nAll modules combined deliver full-function 10/100 Mbps Media Access Control. The \nEthernet IP Core can operate in half- or full-duplex mode and is based on the CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection) protocol..  \nWhen a station wants to transmit in half-duplex mode, it must observe the activity on the \nmedia (Carrier Sense). As soon as the media is idle (no transmission), any station can start transmitting (Multiple Access). If two or more stations are transmitting at the same time, a collision on the media is detected. All stations stop transmitting and back off for some random time. After the back-off time, the station checks the activity on the media again. If the media is idle, it starts transmitting. All other stations wait for the current transmission to end.  \nIn full-duplex mode, the Carrier Sense and the Collision Detect signals are ignored. The \nMAC Control module takes care of sending and receiving the PAUSE control frame to achieve Flow control (see the TXFLOW and RXFLOW bit description in the CTRLMODER register for more information).   \nNovember 27, 2002    Ethernet IP Core Specification \n   \n \nhttp://www.opencores.org  Rev 1.19  22 of 42 The MII Management module provides a media independent interface (MII) to the \nexternal PHY. This way, the configuration and status registers of the PHY can be read from/written to.  \n \n4.1 Resetting Ethernet Core \nThe RST_I signal is used for resetting all sub-modules except the MIIM module. Setting \nthe MIIMRST bit in the MIIMODER register to 1 resets the MIIM module. To reset the PHY, assert its RESET signal either through the boars system control register or by writing an appropriate bit in the PHY register. \n \n4.2 Host Interface Operation \nThe host interface connects the Ethernet IP Core to the rest of the system (RISC, \nmemory) via the WISHBONE bus. The WISHBONE serves to access the configuration \nregisters and the memory. Currently, only DMA transfers are supported for transferring the data from/to the memory.  \n \n4.2.1 Configuration Registers \nThe function of the configuration registers is transparent and can be easily understood by \nreading the Registers section (Chapter 3).  \n \n4.2.2 Buffer Descriptors (BD) \nThe transmission and the reception processes are based on the descriptors. The Transmit \nDescriptors (TxD) are used for transmission while the Receive Descriptors (RxD) are used for reception.  \nThe buffer descriptors are 64 bits long. The first 32 bits are reserved for length and status \nwhile the last 32 bits contain the pointer to the associated buffer (where data is stored). The Ethernet MAC core has an internal RAM that can store up to 128 BDs (for both Rx and Tx). \nThe internal memory saves all descriptors at addresses from 0x400 to 0x7ff (128 64bit \ndescriptors). The transmit descriptors are located between the start address (0x400) and  \nNovember 27, 2002    Ethernet IP Core Specification \n   \n \nhttp://www.opencores.org  Rev 1.19  23 of 42 the address that equals the value written in the TX_BD_NUM register (page 14) \nmultiplied by 8. This register holds the number of the used Tx buffer descriptors. The receive descriptors are located between the start address (0x400), plus the address number written in the TX_BD_NUM multiplied by 8, and the descriptor end address (0x7ff).  \nThe transmit and receive status of the packet is written to the associated buffer descriptor \nonce its transmission/reception is finished.  \n  \nNovember 27, 2002    Ethernet IP Core Specification \n   \n \nhttp://www.opencores.org  Rev 1.19  24 of 42 4.2.2.1 Tx Buffer Descriptors \nThe transmit descriptors contain information about associated buffers (length, status) and \npointers to the buffers holding the relevant data. \n \nADDR = Offset + 0 \n31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Ethernet IP Core<|>organization<|>The Ethernet IP Core is a full-function 10/100 Mbps Media Access Control system that can operate in half- or full-duplex mode, based on the CSMA/CD protocol.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WISHBONE<|>organization<|>WISHBONE is a bus interface used to connect the Ethernet Core to the rest of the system via DMA transfers and to access configuration registers and memory.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MII Management Module<|>organization<|>The MII Management Module provides a media independent interface (MII) to the external PHY, allowing configuration and status registers of the PHY to be read from/written to.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAC Control Module<|>organization<|>The MAC Control Module performs full duplex flow control functions, including sending and receiving PAUSE control frames.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TX Ethernet MAC<|>organization<|>The TX Ethernet MAC performs transmit functions for the Ethernet IP Core.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RX Ethernet MAC<|>organization<|>The RX Ethernet MAC performs receive functions for the Ethernet IP Core.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>November 27, 2002<|>event<|>November 27, 2002 is the date of the Ethernet IP Core Specification document.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>http://www.opencores.org<|>organization<|>http://www.opencores.org is the website hosting the Ethernet IP Core Specification document.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ethernet IP Core<|>WISHBONE<|>The Ethernet IP Core connects to the system via the WISHBONE bus<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ethernet IP Core<|>MII Management Module<|>The Ethernet IP Core includes the MII Management Module for PHY control<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ethernet IP Core<|>MAC Control Module<|>The Ethernet IP Core includes the MAC Control Module for flow control<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ethernet IP Core<|>TX Ethernet MAC<|>The Ethernet IP Core includes the TX Ethernet MAC for transmit functions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ethernet IP Core<|>RX Ethernet MAC<|>The Ethernet IP Core includes the RX Ethernet MAC for receive functions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ethernet IP Core<|>November 27, 2002<|>The Ethernet IP Core Specification was published on November 27, 2002<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ethernet IP Core<|>http://www.opencores.org<|>The Ethernet IP Core Specification is hosted on http://www.opencores.org<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
