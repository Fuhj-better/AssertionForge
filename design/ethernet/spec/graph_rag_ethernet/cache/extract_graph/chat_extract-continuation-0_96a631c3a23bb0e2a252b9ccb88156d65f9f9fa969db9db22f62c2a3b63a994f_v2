Even if the \nBD is marked as ready, the frame is not transmitted if the length is too small. \n  \nNovember 27, 2002    Ethernet IP Core Specification \n   \n \nhttp://www.opencores.org  Rev 1.19  29 of 42 4.2.4 Frame Reception \nTo receive the first frame, the RISC must do several things, namely: \n/checkbld Set the receive buffer descriptor to be associated with the received packet and mark it \nas empty. \n/checkbld Enable the Ethernet receive function by setting the RECEN bit to 1.  \nThe Ethernet IP Core reads the Rx BD. If it is marked as empty, it starts receiving frames. \nThe Ethernet receive function receives an incoming frame nibble per nibble. After the whole frame has been received and stored to the memory, the receive status is written to the BD. An interrupt might be generated (if enabled). Then the BD address is incremented and the next BD loaded. If the new BD is marked as empty, another frame can be received; otherwise the operation stops. \n \nNOTE: Only frames with length greater than 4 bytes are received without an error. \nSmaller frames are received with a CRC error (CRC is 4-bytes long). \n  \nNovember 27, 2002    Ethernet IP Core Specification \n   \n \nhttp://www.opencores.org  Rev 1.19  30 of 42 4.3 TX Ethernet MAC \nThe TX Ethernet MAC generates 10BASE-T/100BASE-TX transmit MII nibble data \nstreams in response to the byte streams the transmit logic (host) supplies. It performs the required deferral and back-off algorithms, takes care of the inter-packet gap (IPG), computes the checksum (FCS), and monitors the physical media (by monitoring Carrier Sense and collision signals). The TX Ethernet MAC is divided into several modules that provide the following functionality: \n/checkbld Generation of the signals connected to the Ethernet PHY during the transmission process \n/checkbld Generation of the status signals the host uses to track the transmission process \n/checkbld Random time generation used in the back-off process after a collision has been detected \n/checkbld CRC generation and checking \n/checkbld Pad generation \n/checkbld Data nibble generation \n \n4.4 RX Ethernet MAC \nThe RX Ethernet MAC transmits the data streams to the host in response to the 10BASE-\nT or 100BASE-TX received MII nibbles. The module is divided into several sub-modules providing the following functionality:  \n/checkbld Preamble removal \n/checkbld Data assembly (from input nibble to output byte) \n/checkbld CRC checking for all incoming packets  \n/checkbld Generation of the signal that can be used for address recognition (in the hash table) \n/checkbld Generation of the status signals the host uses to track the reception process  \n  \nNovember 27, 2002    Ethernet IP Core Specification \n   \n \nhttp://www.opencores.org  Rev 1.19  31 of 42 4.5 MAC Control Module \nThe MAC Control Module performs a real-time flow control function for the full-duplex \noperation. The control opcode PAUSE is used for stopping the station transmitting the packets. The receive buffer (FIFO) starts filling up when the upper layer cannot continue accepting the incoming packets. Before an overflow happens, the upper layer sends a PAUSE control frame to the transmitting station. This control frame inhibits the transmission of the data frames for a specified period of time.  \nWhen the MAC Control module receives a PAUSE control frame, it loads the pause timer \nwith the received value into the pause timer value field. The Tx MAC is stopped (paused) from transmitting the data frames for the “pause timer value” slot times. The pause timer decrements by one each time a slot time passes by. When the pause time number equals zero, the MAC transmitter resumes the transmit operation.  \nThe MAC Control Module has the following functionality: \n/checkbld Control frame detection  \n/checkbld Control frame generation  \n/checkbld TX/RX MAC Interface  \n/checkbld PAUSE Timer \n/checkbld Slot Timer \n \n4.5.1 Control Frame Detection  \nThe incoming data packets are passed from the receiver via the MAC Control Module to \nthe upper layers while the control frames are usually dropped.  \n The RXFLOW bit in the CTRLMODER register defines whether the pause control frame \ncauses the transmitter to break the transmission or not. If RXFLOW bit is set then the RXC interrupt is set in the INT_SOURCE register. The PASSALL bit in the CTRLMODER register defines whether the control frames are stored to the memory or not (regardless to the RXFLOW bit). If the PASSALL bit is set then the control frame is stored to the memory and related buffer descriptor has the control frame bit (CF) set to 1.
