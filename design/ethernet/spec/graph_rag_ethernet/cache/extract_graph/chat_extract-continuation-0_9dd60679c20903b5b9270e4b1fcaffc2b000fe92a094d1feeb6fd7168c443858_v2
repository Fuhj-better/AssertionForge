After the data from the associated buffer has been \ntransmitted or after an error condition occurred, this bit is cleared to 0.  \n1 = The data buffer is ready for transmission or is currently being \ntransmitted. You are not allowed to manipulate this descriptor once this bit \nis set.  \n14 RW IRQ – Interrupt Request Enable \n0 = No interrupt is generated after the transmission.  \n1 = When data associated with this buffer descriptor is sent, a TXB or TXE \ninterrupt will be asserted (see 3.2 INT_SOURCE (Interrupt Source Register) \nfor more details).  \n13 RW WR – Wrap \n0 = This buffer descriptor is not the last descriptor in the buffer descriptor \ntable.  \n1 = This buffer descri ptor is the last descri ptor in the buffer descri ptor table. \nNovember 27, 2002    Ethernet IP Core Specification \n   \n \nhttp://www.opencores.org  Rev 1.19  25 of 42 Bit # Access Description \nAfter this buffer descriptor was used, the first buffer descriptor in the table \nwill be used again.  \n12 RW PAD – Pad Enable \n0 = No pads will be add at the end of short packets.  \n1 = Pads will be added to the end of short packets.  \n11 RW CRC – CRC Enable \n0 = CRC won’t be added at the end of the packet. \n1 = CRC will be added at the end of the packet. \n10:9  Reserved \n8 RW UR – Underrun  \nUnderrun occurred while sending this buffer. \n7:4 RW RTRY – Retry Count  \nThis bit indicates the number of retries before the frame was successfully \nsent.  \n3 RW RL – Retransmission Limit  \nThis bit is set when the transmitter fails. (Retry Limit + 1) attempts to \nsuccessfully transmit a message due to repeated collisions on the medium. \nThe Retry Limit is set in the COLLCONF register on page 14.  \n2 RW LC – Late Collision \nLate collision occurred while sending this buffer. The transmission is \nstopped and this bit is written. Late collision is defined in the COLLCONF \nregister on page 14. \n1 RW DF – Defer Indication \nThe frame was deferred before being sent successfully, i.e. the transmitter \nhad to wait for Carrier Sense before sending because the line was busy. \nThis is not a collision indication. Collisions are indicated in RTRY.  \n0 RW CS – Carrier Sense Lost \nThis bit is set when Carrier Sense is lost during a frame transmission.
