Signal direction is with respect to the Ethernet IP Core.  \n \nPort Width Direction Description \nMTxClk 1 I Transmit Nibble or Symbol Clock. The PHY provides the \nMTxClk signal. It operates at a frequency of 25 MHz (100 \nMbps) or 2.5 MHz (10 Mbps). The clock is used as a \ntiming reference for the transfer of MTxD[3:0], MtxEn, and \nMTxErr.  \nMTxD[3:0] 4 O Transmit Data Nibble. Signals are the transmit data \nnibbles. They are synchronized to the rising edge of \nMTxClk. When MTxEn is asserted, PHY accepts the \nMTxD.  \nMTxEn 1 O Transmit Enable. When asserted, this signal indicates to \nthe PHY that the data MTxD[3:0] is valid and the \ntransmission can start. The transmission starts with the \nfirst nibble of the preamble. The signal remains asserted \nuntil all nibbles to be transmitted are presented to the \nPHY. It is deasserted prior to the first MTxClk, following \nthe final nibble of a frame.  \nMTxErr 1 O Transmit Coding Error. When asserted for one MTxClk \nclock period while MTxEn is also asserted, this signal \ncauses the PHY to transmit one or more symbols that are \nnot part of the valid data or delimiter set somewhere in the \nframe being transmitted to indicate that there has been a \ntransmit coding error.  \nMRxClk 1 I Receive Nibble or Symbol Clock. The PHY provides the \nMRxClk signal. It operates at a frequency of 25 MHz (100 \nMbps) or 2.5 MHz (10 Mbps). The clock is used as a \ntiming reference for the reception of MRxD[3:0], MRxDV, \nand MRxErr.  \nMRxDV 1 I Receive Data Valid. The PHY asserts this signal to \nindicate to the Rx MAC that it is presentin g the valid  \nNovember 27, 2002    Ethernet IP Core Specification \n   \n \nhttp://www.opencores.org  Rev 1.19  5 of 42 Port Width Direction Description \nnibbles on the MRxD[3:0] signals. The signal is asserted \nsynchronously to the MRxClk. MRxDV is asserted from \nthe first recovered nibble of the frame to the final \nrecovered nibble. It is then deasserted prior to the first \nMRxClk that follows the final nibble.  \nMRxD \n[3:0] 4 I Receive Data Nibble. These signals are the receive data \nnibble. They are synchronized to the rising edge of \nMRxClk. When MRxDV is asserted, the PHY sends a data \nnibble to the Rx MAC. For a correctly interpreted frame, \nseven bytes of a preamble and a completely formed SFD \nmust be passed across the interface.  \nMRxErr 1 I Receive Error. The PHY asserts this signal to indicate to \nthe Rx MAC that a media error was detected during the \ntransmission of the current frame. MRxErr is synchronous \nto the MRxClk and is asserted for one or more MRxClk \nclock periods and then deasserted.  \nMColl 1 I Collision Detected. The PHY asynchronously asserts the \ncollision signal MColl after the collision\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Ethernet IP Core Specification<|>Document<|>Specification document for the Ethernet IP Core, detailing interface ports and their descriptions, dated November 27, 2002, and maintained by OpenCores.org.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OpenCores.org<|>Organization<|>Organization hosting the Ethernet IP Core Specification and other open-source hardware projects.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Table 1: Host Interface Ports<|>Table<|>Table listing the host interface ports of the Ethernet IP Core, including their width, direction, and description.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHY Interface ports<|>Section<|>Section describing the ports connecting the Ethernet IP Core to the PHY Interface, including signal directions and descriptions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MTxClk<|>Signal<|>Transmit Nibble or Symbol Clock provided by the PHY, operating at 25 MHz (100 Mbps) or 2.5 MHz (10 Mbps), used as a timing reference for data transfer.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MTxD[3:0]<|>Signal<|>Transmit Data Nibble signals, synchronized to the rising edge of MTxClk, used to send data to the PHY when MTxEn is asserted.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MTxEn<|>Signal<|>Transmit Enable signal indicating to the PHY that the data MTxD[3:0] is valid and transmission can start.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MTxErr<|>Signal<|>Transmit Coding Error signal causing the PHY to transmit invalid symbols when asserted during a frame transmission.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRxClk<|>Signal<|>Receive Nibble or Symbol Clock provided by the PHY, operating at 25 MHz (100 Mbps) or 2.5 MHz (10 Mbps), used as a timing reference for data reception.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRxDV<|>Signal<|>Receive Data Valid signal indicating to the Rx MAC that valid nibbles are being presented on MRxD[3:0].)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRxD[3:0]<|>Signal<|>Receive Data Nibble signals, synchronized to the rising edge of MRxClk, used to send data to the Rx MAC when MRxDV is asserted.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRxErr<|>Signal<|>Receive Error signal indicating to the Rx MAC that a media error was detected during the current frame transmission.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MColl<|>Signal<|>Collision Detected signal asynchronously asserted by the PHY to indicate a collision.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ethernet IP Core Specification<|>OpenCores.org<|>The specification is hosted and maintained by OpenCores.org<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ethernet IP Core Specification<|>Table 1: Host Interface Ports<|>The specification contains Table 1 listing host interface ports<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ethernet IP Core Specification<|>PHY Interface ports<|>The specification includes a section describing PHY Interface ports<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHY Interface ports<|>MTxClk<|>The PHY Interface ports section describes the MTxClk signal<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHY Interface ports<|>MTxD[3:0]<|>The PHY Interface ports section describes the MTxD[3:0] signals<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHY Interface ports<|>MTxEn<|>The PHY Interface ports section describes the MTxEn signal<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHY Interface ports<|>MTxErr<|>The PHY Interface ports section describes the MTxErr signal<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHY Interface ports<|>MRxClk<|>The PHY Interface ports section describes the MRxClk signal<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHY Interface ports<|>MRxDV<|>The PHY Interface ports section describes the MRxDV signal<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHY Interface ports<|>MRxD[3:0]<|>The PHY Interface ports section describes the MRxD[3:0] signals<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHY Interface ports<|>MRxErr<|>The PHY Interface ports section describes the MRxErr signal<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHY Interface ports<|>MColl<|>The PHY Interface ports section describes the MColl signal<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
