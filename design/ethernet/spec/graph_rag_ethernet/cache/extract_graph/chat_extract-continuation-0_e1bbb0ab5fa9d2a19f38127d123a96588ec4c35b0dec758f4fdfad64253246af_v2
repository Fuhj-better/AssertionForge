The core can read or write \nthis BD. As long as this bit is zero, this buffer descriptor won’t be used.  \n1 = The data buffer is empty (and ready for receiving data) or currently \nreceiving data.  \n14 RW IRQ – Interrupt Request Enable \n0 = No interrupt is generated after the reception.  \n1 = When data is received (or error occurs), an RXF interrupt will be \nasserted (See 3.2 INT_SOURCE (Interrupt Source Register) for more \ndetails). \n13 RW WRAP \n0 = This buffer descriptor is not the last descriptor in the buffer descriptor \ntable.  \n1 = This buffer descriptor is the last descriptor in the buffer descriptor table. \nAfter this buffer descriptor is used, the first Rx buffer descriptor in the table \nwill be used again.   \nNovember 27, 2002    Ethernet IP Core Specification \n   \n \nhttp://www.opencores.org  Rev 1.19  27 of 42 Bit # Access Description \n12:9  Reserved. \n8 RW CF – Control Frame \n0 = Normal data frame received \n1 = Control frame received \n7 RW M – Miss \n0 = The frame is received because of an address recognition hit. \n1 = The frame is received because of promiscuous mode. \nThe Ethernet controller sets M for frames that are accepted in promiscuous \nmode but are tagged as a miss by internal address recognition. Thus, in \npromiscuous mode, M determines whether a frame is destined for this \nstation. \n6 RW OR – Overrun \nThis bit is set when a receiver overrun occurs during frame reception. \n5 RW IS – Invalid Symbol \nThis bit is set when the reception of an invalid symbol is detected by the \nPHY. \n4 RW DN – Dribble Nibble \nThis bit is set when a received frame cannot de divided by 8 (one extra \nnibble has been received). \n3 RW TL – Too Long \nThis bit is set when a received frame is too long (bigger than the value set in \nthe PACKETLEN register (page 13).  \n2 RW SF – Short Frame \nThis bit is set when a frame that is smaller than the minimum length is \nreceived (minimum length is set in the PACKETLEN register (page 13)). \n1 RW CRC – Rx CRC Error \nThis bit is set when a received frame contains a CRC error. \n0 RW LC – Late Collision \nThis bit is set when a late collision occurred while receiving a frame. \nTable 28: Rx Buffer Descriptor \n \nBit # Access Description \n31-0 RW RXPNT – Receive Pointer \nThis is the pointer to the buffer storing the associated frame.  \nTable 29: Rx Buffer pointer \n  \nNovember 27, 2002    Ethernet IP Core Specification \n   \n \nhttp://www.opencores.org  Rev 1.19  28 of 42 4.2.3 Frame Transmission \nTo transmit the first frame, the RISC must do several things, namely: \n/checkbld Store the frame to the memory.  \n/checkbld Associate the Tx BD in the Ethernet MAC core with the packet written to the memory \n(length, pad, crc, etc.). See section 4.2.2 Buffer Descriptors (BD) for more information. \n/checkbld Enable the TX part of the Ethernet Core by setting the TXEN bit to 1.  \nAs soon as the Ethernet IP Core is enabled, it continuously reads the first BD. \nImmediately when the descriptor is marked as ready, the core reads the pointer to the memory storing the associated data and starts then reading data to the internal FIFO. At the moment the FIFO is full, transmission begins.  \nAt the end of the transmission, the transmit status is written to the buffer descriptor and \nan interrupt might be generated (when enabled). Next, two events might occur (according to the WR bit (wrap) in the descriptor): \n/checkbld If the WR bit has not been set, the BD address is incremented, the next descriptor is loaded, and the process starts all over again (if next BD is marked as ready).  \n/checkbld If the WR bit has been set, the first BD address (base) is loaded again. As soon as the BD is marked as ready, transmission will start. \n \nNOTE: Only frames with length greater than 4 bytes are transmitted. Even if the \nBD is marked as ready, the frame is not transmitted if\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Ethernet IP Core Specification<|>Document<|>Specification document detailing the Ethernet IP Core, including buffer descriptors, frame transmission, and interrupt mechanisms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RXPNT<|>Register<|>Receive Pointer register pointing to the buffer storing the associated frame.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIGURE 2<|>Figure<|>Figure 2 illustrates the Rx Buffer Descriptor structure.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE 28<|>Table<|>Table 28 describes the Rx Buffer Descriptor fields and their functions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE 29<|>Table<|>Table 29 describes the Rx Buffer Pointer register and its usage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>November 27, 2002<|>Date<|>Date associated with the revision of the Ethernet IP Core Specification document.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>http://www.opencores.org<|>Reference<|>Reference URL for the Ethernet IP Core Specification document, version 1.19.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ethernet IP Core Specification<|>FIGURE 2<|>The document includes Figure 2 to illustrate the Rx Buffer Descriptor<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ethernet IP Core Specification<|>TABLE 28<|>The document includes Table 28 to describe the Rx Buffer Descriptor fields<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ethernet IP Core Specification<|>TABLE 29<|>The document includes Table 29 to describe the Rx Buffer Pointer register<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ethernet IP Core Specification<|>November 27, 2002<|>The document is dated November 27, 2002<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ethernet IP Core Specification<|>http://www.opencores.org<|>The document is referenced at the provided URL<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
