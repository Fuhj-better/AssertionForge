The MIIM \nperforms a continuous read operation of the PHY Status register. The PHY is selected by the FIAD[4:0] signals. The link status LinkFail signal is asserted/deasserted by the MIIM module and reflects the link status bit of the PHY Status register. The signal NVALID is used for qualifying the validity of the LinkFail signals and the status data PRSD[15:0]. These signals are invalid until the first scan status operation ends.  \nDuring the scan status operation, the BUSY signal is asserted until the last read is \nperformed (the scan status operation is stopped).  \n \n4.6.2 Shift Registers Operation \nThere are two shift registers in the MII Management Module. The Data Shift register is \nused for: \n/checkbld Shifting out the data to the PHY during the Write Data Control operation \n/checkbld Shifting in the data during the Read Status operation  \n/checkbld Shifting out the FIAD[4:0] and RGAD[4:0] addresses during all operations \nThe Status Shift register contains the data latched during the last Read Status Operation. \nTwo additional status signals (LinkFail Status and Status Invalid NVALID) are latched separately from the Status Shift register.  \nWhen a Scan Operation is requested, the state of the PRSD[15:0] and a MIILF is \nconstantly updated from the selected PHY register. NVALID is used to qualify the  \nNovember 27, 2002    Ethernet IP Core Specification \n   \n \nhttp://www.opencores.org  Rev 1.19  37 of 42 validity of the PRSD[15:0] and MIILS signals. These signals are invalid until the first \nScan Status Operation ends. \n \n4.6.3 Output Control Module Operation \nThe Output Control Module combines the MDI, MDO, and MDOEN signals into a bi-\ndirectional MDIO signal that is connected to the external MII PHY. During the Write Control Data Operation, the MDIO operates as an output from the MIIM module. The signal is used for transferring data from the MIIM Module to the PHY. During the Read Status Operation, the MDIO first operates as an output (addressing the PHY and the PHY Internal register) and then as an input to the MIIM Module (reading the status data). In both cases the most significant bit of the data is shifted first. When no operation is performed, the MDIO is tri-stated.  \n \n4.6.4 Clock Generator Operation \nThe Management Data Clock MDC is a divided host clock. The division factor is set in \nthe MIIMODER register by setting the CLKDIV[7:0] field (MDC depends on the PHY and can be 2.5 MHz or 12.5 MHz.  \nNovember 27, 2002    Ethernet IP Core Specification \n   \n \nhttp://www.opencores.org  Rev 1.19  38 of 42 5  \nArchitecture \nThe Ethernet IP Core consists of 5 modules:  \n/checkbld Host Interface and the BD structure \n/checkbld TX Ethernet MAC (transmit function) \n/checkbld RX Ethernet MAC (receive function) \n/checkbld MAC Control Module \n/checkbld MII Management Module  \nNovember 27, 2002    Ethernet IP Core Specification \n   \n \nhttp://www.opencores.org  Rev 1.19  39 of 42 Figure 4: Architecture Overview TX Ethernet MAC\nMAC Control Module\n(Flow control)\nRX Ethernet MACEthernet\nMII Management ModulEthernet PHYMAC\nTx Data\nTx PHY\nControl\nSignals\nRx Data\nRx PHY\nControl\nSignalsHost Interface\n(Registers, WISHBONE\ninterface, DMA support,)Wishbone\nbusTx Control\nSignals\nTx Control\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MIIM<|>Module<|>MIIM (MII Management Module) performs operations like read, write, and scan status, and manages communication with the PHY via signals like MDO, MDI, and BUSY.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHY<|>Module<|>PHY (Physical Layer Device) interacts with the MIIM module, responds to read/write operations, and provides status data via PRSD[15:0] and LinkFail signals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIAD[4:0]<|>Signal<|>FIAD[4:0] is a 5-bit signal used to select the PHY address during operations like scan status.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RGAD[4:0]<|>Signal<|>RGAD[4:0] is a 5-bit signal representing the PHY register address for read/write operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRSD[15:0]<|>Signal<|>PRSD[15:0] is a 16-bit data signal carrying status information from the PHY to the MIIM module.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LinkFail<|>Signal<|>LinkFail is a status signal reflecting the link status bit of the PHY Status register, qualified by NVALID.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVALID<|>Signal<|>NVALID is a signal used to qualify the validity of LinkFail and PRSD[15:0] during scan status operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUSY<|>Signal<|>BUSY is asserted by MIIM during operations to indicate activity and deasserted when valid data is available on PRSD[15:0].)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCANSTAT<|>Signal<|>SCANSTAT is a signal initiated by the host to start a continuous read operation of the PHY Status register.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MDIO<|>Port<|>MDIO is a bidirectional port combining MDI, MDO, and MDOEN signals for data transfer between MIIM and PHY.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MDC<|>Clock<|>MDC is a divided host clock (2.5 MHz or 12.5 MHz) generated by the MIIM module for PHY communication.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Ethernet IP Core<|>Module<|>Ethernet IP Core consists of 5 modules: Host Interface, TX/RX Ethernet MAC, MAC Control Module, and MII Management Module.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIIM<|>PHY<|>MIIM communicates with PHY via signals like PRSD[15:0] and LinkFail during read/write operations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIIM<|>FIAD[4:0]<|>MIIM uses FIAD[4:0] to select the PHY address<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIIM<|>RGAD[4:0]<|>MIIM uses RGAD[4:0] to address PHY registers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIIM<|>PRSD[15:0]<|>MIIM receives status data from PHY via PRSD[15:0]<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIIM<|>LinkFail<|>MIIM monitors LinkFail signal for PHY link status<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIIM<|>NVALID<|>MIIM uses NVALID to validate LinkFail and PRSD[15:0]<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIIM<|>BUSY<|>MIIM asserts BUSY during operations to indicate activity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIIM<|>SCANSTAT<|>MIIM performs scan status operations when SCANSTAT is asserted<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIIM<|>MDIO<|>MIIM uses MDIO for bidirectional data transfer with PHY<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIIM<|>MDC<|>MIIM generates MDC clock for PHY communication<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ethernet IP Core<|>MIIM<|>Ethernet IP Core includes the MII Management Module as one of its components<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
