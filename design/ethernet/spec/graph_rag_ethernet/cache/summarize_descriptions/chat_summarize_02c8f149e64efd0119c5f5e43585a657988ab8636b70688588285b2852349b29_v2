It contains fields such as **MIINOPRE** and **CLKDIV**, which are used to control specific aspects of the MII interface operation. The register has a default reset value of **00000064h**, indicating its initial state upon system initialization.  \n\nThis register plays a key role in configuring the MII interface, ensuring proper communication and timing settings. The presence of **MIINOPRE** and **CLKDIV** fields suggests that it may influence clock division and preamble suppression functionalities, though further documentation would be required for exact behavioral details.
