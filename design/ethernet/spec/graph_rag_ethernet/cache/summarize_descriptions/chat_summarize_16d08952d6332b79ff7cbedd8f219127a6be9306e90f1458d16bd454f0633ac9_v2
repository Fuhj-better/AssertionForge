It is primarily used to link the host interface to the RISC processor and memory in the Ethernet IP Core. The protocol facilitates communication between these elements by standardizing the signals and data transfer methods. WISHBONE signals serve as the physical and logical means of interconnection, ensuring efficient and reliable data exchange between the host interface and other system components, such as the RISC processor and memory. This makes WISHBONE a critical component in enabling cohesive operation within the Ethernet IP Core architecture.  \n\nIn summary, WISHBONE acts as a versatile and standardized bus protocol that streamlines connectivity between the host interface, RISC processor, and memory, ensuring seamless integration and communication in embedded systems like the Ethernet IP Core.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751804780, "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 345, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
