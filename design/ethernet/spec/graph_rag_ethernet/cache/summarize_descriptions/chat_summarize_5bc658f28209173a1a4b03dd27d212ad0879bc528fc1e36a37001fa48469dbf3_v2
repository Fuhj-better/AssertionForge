It manages various functions of the Ethernet IP Core, including packet handling and duplex mode configuration. The register serves as a centralized control mechanism, enabling the adjustment of core behaviors to suit different networking requirements. By configuring MODER, users can optimize performance for specific use cases, such as full-duplex or half-duplex communication, as well as fine-tune packet processing parameters. Its role is critical in ensuring the Ethernet core operates efficiently and aligns with the desired network setup.  \n\nThe two provided descriptions are complementary, emphasizing MODER's dual role in overseeing both basic operational modes and specific Ethernet IP Core functionalities.
