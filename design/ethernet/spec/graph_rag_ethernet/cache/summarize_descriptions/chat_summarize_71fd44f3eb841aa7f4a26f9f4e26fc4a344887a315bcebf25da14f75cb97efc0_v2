It operates in both half-duplex and full-duplex modes, utilizing the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol for efficient data transmission. The core provides a full-function implementation, enabling seamless integration into various networking applications.  \n\nIn addition to its operational capabilities, the **ETHERNET IP CORE** includes a detailed specification featuring registers and interfaces essential for managing Ethernet communication. Key registers such as **MODER**, **INT_SOURCE**, and **MII** facilitate control, status monitoring, and interfacing with the Media Independent Interface (MII). These components ensure robust configuration and real-time management of Ethernet operations.  \n\nCombining both hardware functionality and software-configurable elements, the **ETHERNET IP CORE** serves as a versatile solution for embedded systems and networking devices requiring reliable 10/100 Mbps Ethernet connectivity. Its dual-mode operation and structured register set make it adaptable to diverse implementation requirements while maintaining compliance with standard Ethernet protocols.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751804900, "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 222, "prompt_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 432, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
