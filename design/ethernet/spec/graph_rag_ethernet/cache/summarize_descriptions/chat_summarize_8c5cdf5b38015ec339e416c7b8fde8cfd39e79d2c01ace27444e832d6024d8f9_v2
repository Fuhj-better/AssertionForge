This register serves as a key interface for managing the module's operations, allowing system designers or firmware to adjust its functionality as needed. The **MAC Control Module** interacts directly with the **CTRLMODER register**, indicating a bidirectional relationship where the register influences the module's behavior while the module may also provide feedback or status updates via the register.  \n\nIn summary, the **CTRLMODER register** is an essential control mechanism for the **MAC Control Module**, defining its operational parameters and enabling dynamic configuration.
