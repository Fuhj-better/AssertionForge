When specific conditions or events occur, the module updates the **INT_SOURCE Register** to signal these interrupts, enabling the system to handle them appropriately. Both descriptions confirm that the **MAC Control Module** interacts with the **INT_SOURCE Register** by setting interrupt flags, ensuring consistent and coherent functionality. There are no contradictions in the provided descriptions, as they both emphasize the module's role in configuring interrupts within the register.  \n\nIn summary, the **MAC Control Module** serves as a critical component in interrupt management, directly modifying the **INT_SOURCE Register** to flag and communicate system interrupts.
