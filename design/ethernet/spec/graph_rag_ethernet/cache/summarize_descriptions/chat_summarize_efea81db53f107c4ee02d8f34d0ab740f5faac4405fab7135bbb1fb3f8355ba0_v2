It provides bit-specific masking capabilities, allowing precise control over various interrupt sources. The register enables or disables interrupts by setting or clearing individual bits, effectively determining which interrupt events are permitted to trigger.  \n\nINT_MASK serves as a critical component in interrupt handling, offering granular control to either mask (disable) or unmask (enable) specific interrupt sources. This functionality ensures that only relevant interrupts are processed while others are temporarily suppressed, improving system efficiency and reducing unnecessary processing overhead.  \n\nIn summary, INT_MASK is an interrupt mask register that governs interrupt events for the Ethernet IP core, providing configurable masking capabilities to selectively enable or disable interrupt sources as needed. Its bit-level control allows for flexible and precise interrupt management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751804540, "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 366, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
