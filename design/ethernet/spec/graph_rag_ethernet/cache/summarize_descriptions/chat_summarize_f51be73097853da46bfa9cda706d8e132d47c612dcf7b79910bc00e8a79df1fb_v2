While one description states it was published on that date, another suggests it may have been either published or revised. To resolve this discrepancy, the most accurate interpretation is that the specification underwent a significant update—either its initial publication or a major revision—on November 27, 2002. This date marks a key milestone in the development of the Ethernet IP Core, ensuring clarity for its implementation and use in networking technologies.
