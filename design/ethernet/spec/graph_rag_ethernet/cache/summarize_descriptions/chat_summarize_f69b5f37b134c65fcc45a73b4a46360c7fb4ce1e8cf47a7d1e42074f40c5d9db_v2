It is loaded with a pause timer value extracted from a **PAUSE control frame**, which temporarily inhibits data frame transmissions for a specified number of time slots. This mechanism ensures efficient network traffic management by preventing congestion and allowing controlled pauses in data transmission when necessary.  \n\nBy integrating both functionalities—acting as a timer for flow control and enforcing transmission pauses based on PAUSE frame directives—the **PAUSE TIMER** plays a critical role in maintaining stable and orderly communication within the network.
