Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START or Repeated START is generated.   \n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer \nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the slave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit signals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the same address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the master will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th SCL clock cycle.  Note: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See the Philips I\n2C specifications for more details. \n The core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave device’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer the slave address on the bus.   \n4.2.3 Data Transfer \nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a byte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each transferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the slave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data transfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.  If the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases the SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.  To write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the TIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag is reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register contains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read command when the TIP flag is reset.   \n4.2.4 STOP signal \nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP signal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while SCL is at logical ‘1’. OpenCores I2C-Master core 7/3/2003 \nwww.opencores.org  Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15  \n \n4.3 Arbitration Procedure \n \n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization \nThe I2C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected \non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock synchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND connection of the I\n2C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the \nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to count off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in that state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL line will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high by the device with the shortest high period.  \nStart counting\nlow period\nwait\nstateStart counting\nhigh period\nSCL1\nSCL2\nSCLMaster1 SCL\nMaster2 SCL\nwired-AND SCL\n \n \n 4.3.2 Clock Stretching \nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit \nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required period and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL low period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-states. OpenCores I2C-Master core 7/3/2003 \nwww.opencores.org  Rev 0.8 Preliminary 10 of 15 5 \nArchitecture \n \nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte Command Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register. All other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.  \n \n5.1 Clock Generator \n \nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all synchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller. It also handles clock stretching needed by some slaves.   \n5.2 Byte Command Controller \n The Byte Command Controller handles I2C traffic at the byte level. It takes data from the Command Register and translates it into sequences based on the transmission of a single byte.
