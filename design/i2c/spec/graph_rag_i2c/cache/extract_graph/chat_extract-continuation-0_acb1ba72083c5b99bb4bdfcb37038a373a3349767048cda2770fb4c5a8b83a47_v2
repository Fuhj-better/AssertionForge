The Byte Command Controller tells the Bit Command Controller which operation has to be performed. For a single byte read, the Bit Command Controller receives 8 separate read commands. Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and A, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A, B, and C).

During a read action, data is shifted in from the SDA line. After a byte has been read the contents are copied into the Receive Register. During a write action, the Transmit Register’s contents are copied into the DataIO Shift Register and are then transmitted onto the SDA line.
