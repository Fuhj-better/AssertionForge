OpenCores I2C-Master core 7/3/2003 \nwww.opencores.org  Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15 4 \nOperation \n \n4.1 System Configuration \n \nThe I2C system uses a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL) for data \ntransfers. All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open collector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up resistors.  Data is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line on a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for each data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each transferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA line may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during the high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a command (see START and STOP signals).    \n4.2 I2C Protocol \n Normally, a standard communication consists of four parts: 1) START signal generation \n2) Slave address transfer \n3) Data transfer \n4) STOP signal generation \n \nS A7 A6 A5 A4 A3 A2 A1 RW ACK D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 NACK PSCL\nSDA1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9MSB LSB\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9MSB LSB\n  \n4.2.1 START signal \nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and SDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A START signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of SDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer. A Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The master uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a OpenCores I2C-Master core 7/3/2003 \nwww.opencores.org  Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15 different transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device) \nwithout releasing the bus.  The core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set and the RD or WR bits are set.
