Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\r\n60,OPENMSP430 CORE,\"The **OPENMSP430 CORE** is a microcontroller core designed with a detailed pinout configuration for clock domains and enable signals, ensuring precise control over timing and operational states. As part of its development, the project adheres to the OpenCores recommendations for directory structure, with a top-level directory organized to facilitate modularity, collaboration, and ease of access for developers. This structured approach supports efficient project management and scalability while maintaining compatibility with open-source hardware development practices.  \n\nCombining these aspects, the OPENMSP430 CORE serves as a versatile and well-documented microcontroller solution, integrating hardware design considerations with a standardized project layout to streamline implementation and community contributions. The core’s emphasis on clear pinout configurations and adherence to OpenCores guidelines underscores its suitability for both academic and industrial applications requiring a reliable, open-source microcontroller platform.  \n\n(Word count: 149)\",20\r\n61,CPU_EN,\"**CPU_EN** is an input port designed to enable CPU code execution. It operates asynchronously and is engineered to be non-glitchy, ensuring stable performance. The port is typically set to a logical value of **1** when unused, allowing for seamless integration into systems where CPU execution may not always be required. Both descriptions confirm its asynchronous and non-glitchy behavior, as well as its default state when inactive. This makes CPU_EN a reliable control signal for managing CPU operations in various hardware or embedded systems.  \n\n(Word count: 86)\",2\r\n65,ACLK_EN,\"**ACLK_EN** is an output port exclusively designed for FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) applications. It serves as an enable signal for ACLK (presumably a clock signal), controlling its activation or deactivation within the FPGA environment. The descriptions emphasize that this functionality is specific to FPGA implementations, indicating that ACLK_EN is not applicable or available in non-FPGA contexts. The consistent mention of \"\"FPGA ONLY\"\" across both descriptions confirms its restricted usage scope.  \n\nIn summary, ACLK_EN is a dedicated FPGA output port that generates an enable signal for ACLK, ensuring proper clock management within FPGA-based systems. Its role is limited to FPGA configurations, as highlighted by the repeated specification in the provided descriptions.  \n\n(Word count: 108)\",2\r\n66,SMCLK_EN,\"**SMCLK_EN** is an output port exclusively for FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) applications, specifically designed to enable the **SMCLK** (Sub-Main Clock) signal. The entity serves as a control signal generator, ensuring the activation of the SMCLK when required by the FPGA. Both descriptions confirm that **SMCLK_EN** is FPGA-specific and functions as an enable signal for the SMCLK, with no contradictory information present.  \n\nIn summary, **SMCLK_EN** is a dedicated FPGA output port that provides the enable signal for the Sub-Main Clock (SMCLK), playing a critical role in clock management within FPGA-based systems.\",2\r\n68,DCO_WKUP,\"The **DCO_WKUP** is an output port specific to ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) designs, responsible for generating a fast oscillator wakeup signal. This signal operates asynchronously, meaning it is not synchronized with a clock and can trigger wakeup events independently of the system's primary timing mechanism. The **DCO_WKUP** port is exclusively available in ASIC implementations and is not present in other configurations. Its primary function is to facilitate rapid wakeup from low-power states by leveraging the fast oscillator, ensuring minimal latency during power mode transitions.  \n\nIn summary, **DCO_WKUP** serves as an asynchronous wakeup signal output for ASIC-only applications, enabling efficient and swift system reactivation when needed.\",1\r\n69,LFTX_ENABLE,LFTX_ENABLE is an output port for ASIC ONLY: Low frequency oscillator enable signal,1\r\n216,TB_OPENMSP430.V,,1\r\n210,RAM.V,RAM verilog model component of the openMSP430 project>,1\r\n211,REGISTERS.V,Verilog module providing connections to Core internals for debugging>,1\r\n212,DBG_UART_TASKS.V,UART tasks module for the serial debug interface>,1\r\n213,DBG_I2C_TASKS.V,I2C tasks module for the serial debug interface>,1\r\n214,DMA_TASKS.V,DMA tasks module for direct memory accesses>,1\r\n215,IO_CELL.V,Generic I/O module in the openMSP430 project>,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n68,OPENMSP430 CORE,CPU_EN,CPU_EN is a port of the openMSP430 core,22\r\n72,OPENMSP430 CORE,ACLK_EN,ACLK_EN is a port of the openMSP430 core,22\r\n73,OPENMSP430 CORE,SMCLK_EN,SMCLK_EN is a port of the openMSP430 core,22\r\n75,OPENMSP430 CORE,DCO_WKUP,DCO_WKUP is a port of the openMSP430 core,21\r\n76,OPENMSP430 CORE,LFTX_ENABLE,LFTX_ENABLE is a port of the openMSP430 core,21\r\n308,OPENMSP430 CORE,TB_OPENMSP430.V,Testbench module for verifying the openMSP430 core functionality,21\r\n309,OPENMSP430 CORE,RAM.V,RAM model integrated with the openMSP430 core,21\r\n310,OPENMSP430 CORE,REGISTERS.V,Provides debug access to internal registers of the openMSP430 core,21\r\n311,OPENMSP430 CORE,DBG_UART_TASKS.V,Implements UART debug functionality for the core,21\r\n312,OPENMSP430 CORE,DBG_I2C_TASKS.V,Implements I2C debug functionality for the core,21\r\n313,OPENMSP430 CORE,DMA_TASKS.V,Provides DMA capabilities for the core,21\r\n314,OPENMSP430 CORE,IO_CELL.V,Generic I/O module used in the core implementation,21\r\n135,CPU_EN,MCLK,CPU_EN is related to MCLK as it enables CPU code execution based on the main system clock,10\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
