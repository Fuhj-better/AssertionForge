Conversely, the **DMA_MASTER** itself generates the **DMA_WKUP** signal to restore clocks when initiating a DMA transfer. This indicates a bidirectional relationship where **DMA_WKUP** both triggers and is triggered by the **DMA_MASTER**, ensuring proper clock synchronization for efficient data movement.  \n\nIn summary, the **DMA_MASTER** relies on **DMA_WKUP** to enable its clock domain, while also producing the same signal to initiate or resume DMA operations, creating a coordinated mechanism for power and clock management during transfers.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751777518, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 186, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 370, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 120}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
