This signal operates asynchronously, meaning it is not synchronized with a clock and can trigger wakeup events independently of the system's primary timing mechanism. The **DCO_WKUP** port is exclusively available in ASIC implementations and is not present in other configurations. Its primary function is to facilitate rapid wakeup from low-power states by leveraging the fast oscillator, ensuring minimal latency during power mode transitions.  \n\nIn summary, **DCO_WKUP** serves as an asynchronous wakeup signal output for ASIC-only applications, enabling efficient and swift system reactivation when needed.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751770737, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 175, "total_tokens": 326, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 111}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
