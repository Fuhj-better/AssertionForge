As the original developer of the MSP430 architecture, TI's official documentation serves as a key reference for projects like the openMSP430, ensuring compatibility and consistency in naming conventions for clock signals such as ACLK and SMCLK. The openMSP430 project, which is compatible with TI's MSP430 microcontrollers, relies on TI's documentation for technical accuracy and architectural alignment.
