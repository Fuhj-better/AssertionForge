The **DMA MASTER** coordinates data transfers, driving control signals, while the **OPENMSP430** responds by providing transfer status and read data. Additionally, the **OPENMSP430** supplies clock and reset signals to the **DMA MASTER**, ensuring synchronization between the two components.  \n\nDuring data transfers, the **OPENMSP430** synchronizes operations with the **DMA MASTER**, including inserting wait states if the CPU is occupied, preventing conflicts. This interaction occurs during both read and write operations, with the **OPENMSP430** managing timing and ensuring smooth data flow. Specifically, during read operations, the **OPENMSP430** transfers data to the **DMA MASTER**, completing the exchange initiated by the master.  \n\nIn summary, the **OPENMSP430** and **DMA MASTER** work in tandem, with the **DMA MASTER** initiating and controlling transfers while the **OPENMSP430** handles synchronization, clocking, and data delivery, including adaptive wait state insertion to resolve CPU conflicts.
