(For improving \nsecurity, a n irreducible polynomial with higher degree might be used in the future. ) \n \nThe above elliptic curve contains a large cyclic subgroup of prime order   . Also   divides \n      and not any            , and    does not divide    . Now  (  (  )) \ncontains an  -torsion  group  [ ](  (  )) and  (  (   )) also contains an  -torsion \ngroup  [ ](  (   )). The Tate bilinear pairing (of order  ) is a bilinear map  between \n [ ](  (  )) and  [ ](  (   )) to an element of the multiplicative group    (   ) , \ni.e. \n                                          [ ](  (  ))  [ ](  (   ))   (   )                   (1) \nIt is necessary to raise the value on the right hand side to the power    (     )   to \nobtain a unique value in    (   ). Consider   (     )   (     )  [ ](  (  )) \ni.e.               (  ) and define a distortion map    as \n                                       ( )  (     ) (        )                                           (2) \n, where       (   ) satisfying          and       . Then the Tate \npairing is defined on points      [ ](  (  )) as \n                                        ̂(   )   (   ( ))      (   )                                (3) \nGenerally speaking, the Tate pairing is a transformation that takes  in two elements in the \nelliptic curve point group and outputs a nonzero element in the extension field   (   ). \n \nThe Tate pairing  performs in two stages:  \nStage 1: calculation of  ( )  [ ](  (   )) in the rational function    on  (  (  )) \nsuch that     (  )  [ ]  [ ], i.e.   (   ( ))   ( ( ))     (   ) .
