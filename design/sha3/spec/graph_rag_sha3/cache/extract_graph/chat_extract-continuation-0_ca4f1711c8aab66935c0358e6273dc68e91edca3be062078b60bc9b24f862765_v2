Because of the \nsuccessful attacks on MD5, SHA -0 and theoretical attacks on SHA -1, NIST perceived a \nneed for an alternative, dissimilar cryptographic hash, which became SHA -3 [3]. \nSHA -3 is a family of sponge functions that use a  permutation  as a building block [4]. The \npermutation  (over       ) is a sequence of operations on a state   that is a three -\ndimensional array of elements of       , namely             [4]. The mapping between \nthe bits of          and th e bits of a state   is that the           -th bit of   \nis            for any                . The permutation consist s of 24 rounds , \nindexed with     from 0 to 23 . Each round   consists of five steps  [4]. \n              \n                        ∑              \n     ∑                \n     \n                                  ⁄  \n                         (  \n  ) \n( \n ) ( \n )            \n                 \n                         ( \n ) (  \n  )(  \n  ) \n                             \n             \n                                \n                [    ]                  \n                                                   \nThe additions and multiplications are in       .
