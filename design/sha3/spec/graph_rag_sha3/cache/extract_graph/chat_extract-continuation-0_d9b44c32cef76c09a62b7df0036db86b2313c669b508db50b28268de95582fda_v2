We don ’t want the permutation wait the padding. For t he high throughput core, \npermutation is don e in 12 clock cycles, so its padding module should  prepare  next 576 bit \nin time , so its input width is 64 bit. For the low throughput core , which finishes \npermutation in 2 4 clock cycles , the input  width is fixed in the same way.   OpenCores  SHA3 Core  Specifications  1/29/2013  \n \n \nwww.opencores.org  Rev 0. 1 8 of 13 \n4  \nUsage  and timing  \nBefore computing  a new hash value each time, reset the core. Suppose the core has \ncomputed SHA -3-512(“A”). Then you should first reset the core before letting it compute \nSHA -3-512(“B”). The reset method is to let       be 1, then after one clock cycle to let \n      be 0.  The rising edge of       should be aligned to the rising edge of     . \nIf real width of the input is less than the width of input port ,    should be aligned to the \nmost significant bit.  This may only happens at the last block  of input. Suppose the input \nis one byte data “A”.  You should let          =“A”, (          for the low throughput \ncore) not        =“A”.  \nIf and only if current  input is the last block,          is 1. The value of          takes \neffect  only when          is 1. If the message length is multiple of the input port width, \nyou should provide an additional zero-length block. For example, to hash “ABCDEFGH” , \nfirst s et \n                        \nThen s et \n                     \nYou may provide input in any slow rate. If input is not ready, just l et          be 0, then \nthe core will not  absorb  current input value . \nOnly if             is 0 and          is 1, the core absorbs current value . If in any \nclock cycle                                then next valid value of     should \nbe  . A timing graph below help s understand it. \nThe hash result is ready only if           is 1. After           is 1, the hash result \nremain unchanged until next reset.
