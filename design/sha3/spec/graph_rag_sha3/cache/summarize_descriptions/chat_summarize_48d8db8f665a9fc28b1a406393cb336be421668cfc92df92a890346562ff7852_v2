It performs permutations in **24 clock cycles** with a **fixed input width**, optimizing its performance for specific use cases. This core variant is tailored for implementation on **Spartan 3 FPGAs**, where it operates at a clock frequency of **100MHz**. Its design prioritizes low throughput, making it suitable for applications where power efficiency or resource constraints are critical, such as embedded systems or lightweight cryptographic implementations. The combination of fixed input width and consistent cycle count ensures predictable performance, while its FPGA compatibility allows for flexible deployment in hardware-based security solutions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751859965, "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 320, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
