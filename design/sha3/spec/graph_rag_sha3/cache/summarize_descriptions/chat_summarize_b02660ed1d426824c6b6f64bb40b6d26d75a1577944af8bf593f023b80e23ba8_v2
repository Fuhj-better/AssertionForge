It features a 64-bit input width and is optimized to complete permutations in just 12 clock cycles, ensuring efficient data processing. To further enhance performance, this core variant is capable of processing two rounds per clock cycle, significantly increasing its throughput compared to conventional implementations. This dual-round processing capability makes the **HIGH THROUGHPUT CORE** particularly suited for applications requiring rapid and secure hashing operations, such as in high-speed data transmission or real-time cryptographic systems. The combination of its 64-bit architecture and accelerated round processing ensures a balance between speed and resource efficiency, making it a robust solution for demanding computational environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751859905, "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 152, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 332, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
