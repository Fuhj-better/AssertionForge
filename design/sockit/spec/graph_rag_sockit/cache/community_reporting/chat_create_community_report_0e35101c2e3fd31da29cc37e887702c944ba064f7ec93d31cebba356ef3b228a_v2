It operates using the 1-Wire communication protocol, which allows for efficient data transfer and power delivery over a single wire, simplifying system integration.  \n\nKey features of the DS18S20 include high-precision temperature sensing and the ability to operate in parasite-power mode, where it draws power directly from the data line, eliminating the need for an external power supply. Additionally, each device has a unique 64-bit serial code, enabling individual identification and allowing multiple sensors to coexist on the same 1-Wire bus without address conflicts.  \n\nThe DS18S20 is widely used in applications requiring reliable and accurate temperature measurements, such as environmental monitoring, industrial control systems, and consumer electronics. Its digital output and straightforward interface make it a popular choice for embedded systems and IoT applications.  \n\nWhile the descriptions mention both Dallas Semiconductor and Maxim Integrated as manufacturers, this discrepancy arises from Maxim Integrated's acquisition of Dallas Semiconductor, which led to the continued production of the DS18S20 under Maxim's branding. Thus, the device remains functionally consistent across its production history.  \n\nIn summary, the DS18S20 is a versatile, high-precision digital thermometer with unique addressing capabilities, designed for ease of integration and efficient operation in a variety of temperature-sensing applications.\",5\r\n30,MAXIM-IC,\"**MAXIM-IC (Maxim Integrated)** is a leading manufacturer of analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits, specializing in innovative solutions such as 1-Wire and iButton devices.
