It serves as a technical standard for memory-mapped interfaces, facilitating communication between components within a chip. The specification is designed to streamline the integration of intellectual property (IP) blocks, peripherals, and memory subsystems by providing a standardized switch fabric interface.  \n\nAvalon MM is primarily used in FPGA and SoC environments, enabling efficient data transfer between master and slave devices through a memory-mapped addressing scheme. Its applications include high-performance computing, embedded systems, and custom hardware designs. By adhering to the Avalon MM standard, developers can ensure compatibility and interoperability across different components, simplifying the design process.  \n\nThe specification is part of Altera’s broader **Avalon Interface Family**, which includes other variants like Avalon Streaming (ST). However, Avalon MM specifically focuses on memory-mapped transactions, making it a critical tool for architects and engineers working on complex digital systems.  \n\nIn summary, **AVALON MM** is a well-defined, industry-standard interface by Altera, tailored for memory-mapped communication in SoC and FPGA designs, promoting modularity and scalability in hardware development.\",2\r\n24,ALTERA,,19\r\n122,GNU,\"The **GNU Project** is widely recognized for its licensing frameworks, particularly the **GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 3**, under which numerous scripts, files, and code components are distributed.
