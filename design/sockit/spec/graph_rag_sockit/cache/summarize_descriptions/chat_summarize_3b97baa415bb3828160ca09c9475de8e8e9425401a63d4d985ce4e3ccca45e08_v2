The initial description identifies it as a standard interface for these peripherals, while the expanded extraction confirms its technical specification as a 6-pin Mini-DIN connector. Both descriptions align in characterizing the PS/2 as a connector type, with no contradictions between them. The combined summary reinforces that the PS/2 serves as a hardware interface for input devices, emphasizing its 6-pin Mini-DIN design.  \n\nIn summary, the **PS/2** is a standardized 6-pin Mini-DIN connector commonly utilized for keyboards and mice in computer systems.
