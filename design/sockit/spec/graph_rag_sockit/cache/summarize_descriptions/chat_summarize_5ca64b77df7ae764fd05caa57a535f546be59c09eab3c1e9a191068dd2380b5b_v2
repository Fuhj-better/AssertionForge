It serves as a compact and efficient platform for embedding complex functionalities, including processing, memory, and peripheral interfaces. In the context of hardware design, the SOC is the target platform for implementing specialized modules, such as the **1-wire master**, and integrates Verilog-based hardware descriptions to achieve its intended functionality. By combining computational, memory, and communication elements, the SOC enables streamlined and high-performance embedded systems.
