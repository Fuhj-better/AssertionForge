It is primarily used for integrating hardware components, such as `sockit_owm`, into FPGA-based designs, enabling the creation of customizable system-on-chip (SoC) architectures. The tool facilitates the assembly and configuration of SOPC designs by allowing users to combine various IP cores, processors, memory interfaces, and peripherals into a cohesive system.  \n\nSOPC Builder supports the development of embedded systems by providing a structured environment for component integration, streamlining the design process for Altera FPGAs. Additionally, the tool includes documentation that guides users in rewriting TCL scripts to automate or customize workflows. Its functionality aligns with broader SoC design methodologies, making it a key resource for engineers working on programmable logic platforms.  \n\nIn summary, SOPC Builder serves as a dedicated Altera tool for SOPC and SoC design, offering hardware component integration, scripting support, and a framework for building scalable embedded systems on FPGAs.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751722250, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 219, "prompt_tokens": 296, "total_tokens": 515, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 232}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
