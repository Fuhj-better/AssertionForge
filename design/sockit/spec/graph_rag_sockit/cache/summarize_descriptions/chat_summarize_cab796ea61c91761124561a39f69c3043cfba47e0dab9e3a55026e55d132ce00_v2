This adaptation ensures compatibility with the Nios II processor architecture, allowing the PUBLIC DOMAIN KIT to function within systems utilizing the Nios II HAL framework. Both descriptions confirm the same key detail—the porting process—indicating that the PUBLIC DOMAIN KIT has been integrated into the Nios II HAL environment. This integration likely enables broader accessibility and utility for developers working with Nios II-based systems.
