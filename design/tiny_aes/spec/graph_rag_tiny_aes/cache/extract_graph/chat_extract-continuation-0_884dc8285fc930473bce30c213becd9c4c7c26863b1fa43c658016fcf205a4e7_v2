The block size is restricted to 128 bits. The key size \ncan be  128, 192, or 256 bits. [1] \nAES operates on a 4× 4 matrix of bytes, called  the state . Some  rounds of transformation \nconverts the plaintext into the final cipher -text. The number of rounds is six plus the key \nsize divided  by 32.  One round reads the state into four 4 -byte variables             ; \ntransforms the variables; xor’s them  by a 16 -byte round key; and puts the result \ninto            .[3] \nWhen targeting a variable -length plaintext, the plaintext  must first be partitio ned into \nseparate cipher blocks, and then  be encrypted under some mode of operation, generally \nusing  randomization based on an additional initialization vector .[4] \nThe cipher feedback (CFB) mode, output feedback (OFB) mode are specified in FIPS 81 . \nThe counter (CTR) mode is specified by NIST in  SP800 -38A.[4] The advantage of these \nmodes is only using encryption algorithm for both encryption and decryption. So the AES \nhardware price  may be reduced by 50% (not need decryption hardware).  \nAbout th is project  \nThis project has implemented AES encryption algorithm.  \nThis project provides three cores, doing AES -128, AES -192 and AES -256 encryption \nseparately.  \nThe cores can be used in cipher feedback (CFB) mode, output feedback (OFB) mode, and \ncounter (CTR) mode.  \nThe maximum frequency is 324.6 MHz . The throughput is 37. 5 G bytes /second if with a \n300 MHz clock.
